/** RenderFakeToastContext is a utility that takes a React Component which implements useToastContext
 *  and returns a React Component which renders the component with the context mocked out.
 *  This is useful for testing components that use the useToastContext hook.
 *  It also exposes some methods to assert that the toast context was called with the correct parameters.
 * @param {React.VFC} Component - A React Component which implements useToastContext
 * @returns {Object} response - An object with the following properties:
 * @returns {React.VFC} response.Component - A React Component which renders the component with the context mocked out
 * @returns {Object} response.dispatchToast - A series of jest.fn() methods which can be used to assert that the toast context was called with the correct parameters
 * @returns {Function} response.dispatchToast.success - A jest.fn() method which can be used to assert that the success toast context was called
 * @returns {Function} response.dispatchToast.error - A jest.fn() method which can be used to assert that the error toast context was called
 * @returns {Function} response.dispatchToast.info - A jest.fn() method which can be used to assert that the info toast context was called
 * @returns {Function} response.dispatchToast.warning - A jest.fn() method which can be used to assert that the warning toast context was called
 * @returns {Function} response.dispatchToast.hide - A jest.fn() method which can be used to assert that the hide toast context was called
 * @returns {React.VFC} response.HookWrapper - A React Component which wraps a hook and has the useToastContext mocked out but utilizes the same methods
 * @returns {Function} response.useToastContext - A jest.fn() method which can be used to assert that the useToastContext hook was called
