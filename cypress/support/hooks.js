// Cypress 3.3.1 and below do not support listening to the fetch method
// Therefore, as a workaround we polyfill `fetch` with traditional XHR which
// are supported. See: https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/687
enableFetchWorkaround();

// private helpers
function enableFetchWorkaround() {
  let polyfill;

  before(() => {
    console.info("Load fetch XHR polyfill");
    cy.readFile("./cypress/support/polyfills/unfetch.umd.js").then(content => {
      polyfill = content;
    });
  });

  Cypress.on("window:before:load", win => {
    delete win.fetch;
    // since the application code does not ship with a polyfill
    // load a polyfilled "fetch" from the test
    win.eval(polyfill);
    win.fetch = win.unfetch;
  });
